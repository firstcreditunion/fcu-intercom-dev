# Javascript API: Methods

Loading the Intercom JavaScript library provides an Intercom JavaScript object that responds to a few methods. These allow you to update users without a page refresh and interact with the messenger window.

## Intercom('boot', intercomSettings)

If you'd like to control when Intercom is loaded, you can use the 'boot' method. This is useful in situations like a one-page Javascript based application where the user may not be logged in when the page loads. You call this method with the standard intercomSettings object.

```JavaScript
Intercom('boot', {
    app_id: 'abc12345',
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    created_at: 1234567890,
    name: 'John Doe',
    user_id: '9876'
});
```

```NPM
import { boot } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
boot({
  app_id: 'abc12345',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  created_at: 1234567890,
  name: 'John Doe',
  user_id: '9876'
})
```

## Intercom('shutdown')

If you have the Inbox product (combined with another product like Messages) you should call the Intercom shutdown method to clear your usersâ€™ conversations anytime they logout of your application. Otherwise, the cookie we use to track who was most recently logged in on a given device or computer will keep these conversations in the Messenger for one week. This method will effectively clear out any user data that you have been passing through the JS API.

```JavaScript
Intercom('shutdown');
```

```NPM
import { shutdown } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
shutdown();
```

### Deleting cookies

If you need to delete cookies created by the Messenger but are unable to use this method (e.g. because our JavaScript hasnâ€™t been loaded), all cookies are prefixed with `intercom-` and are created on your domain.

## Intercom('update')

Calling the update method with some new user data will trigger the JavaScript to look for new messages that should be displayed to the current user (the one whose details are in the window.intercomSettings variable) and show them if they exist.

Calling the update method with a JSON object of user details will update those fields on the current user in addition to logging an impression at the current URL and looking for new messages for the user.

```JavaScript
Intercom('update');
```

```JavaScript
Intercom('update', {"name": "Inigo Montoya"});
```

```JavaScript
// Enable dark mode
Intercom('update', {theme_mode: 'dark'});

// Enable light mode
Intercom('update', {theme_mode: 'light'});

// Use system preference
Intercom('update', {theme_mode: 'system'});
```

```NPM
import { update } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
update({"name": "Inigo Montoya"}); // argument is optional

// Theme mode examples
update({theme_mode: 'dark'});
update({theme_mode: 'light'});
update({theme_mode: 'system'});
```

### IDs & Data

If the person's ID is not found in the user list when calling the update, a new user will be created.

If trying to update a `custom_attribute`, you do not need to include those values as an object. Include them in-line with the standard Intercom fields and they will be applied accordingly.

### Update Throttling

You can call `Intercom('update')` without getting throttled up to 20 times per 30 minutes. After the 20th call, you'll be throttled and the quota of 20 calls will get reset every 30 minutes. Reloading the page will refresh this state.

## Intercom('hide')

This will hide the main Messenger panel if it is open. It will not hide the Messenger Launcher.

```JavaScript
Intercom('hide');
```

```NPM
import { hide } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
hide();
```

## Intercom('hideNotifications', hidden)

This controls visibility of in-app notifications in the Messenger. Pass `true` to hide notifications, or `false` to show them. Default is `false` or `window.intercomSettings.hide_notifications` if set.

```JavaScript
// Hide notifications
Intercom('hideNotifications', true);

// Show notifications
Intercom('hideNotifications', false);
```

```NPM
import { hideNotifications } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
// Hide notifications
hideNotifications(true);
// Show notifications
hideNotifications(false);
```

## Intercom('show')

This will show the Messenger. If there are no new conversations, it will open to the Messenger Home. If there are, it will open with the message list.

```JavaScript
Intercom('show');
```

```NPM
import { show } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
show();
```

## Intercom('showSpace', spaceName)

This will show the specified space in the Messenger, if that space is enabled.

```JavaScript
Intercom('showSpace', 'home');
Intercom('showSpace', 'messages');
Intercom('showSpace', 'help');
Intercom('showSpace', 'news');
Intercom('showSpace', 'tasks');
Intercom('showSpace', 'tickets');
```

```NPM
import { showSpace } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
showSpace('home');
showSpace('messages');
showSpace('help');
showSpace('news');
showSpace('tasks');
showSpace('tickets');
```

## Intercom('showMessages')

This will open the Messenger with the message list.

```JavaScript
Intercom('showMessages');
```

```NPM
import { showMessages } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
showMessages();
```

## Intercom('showNewMessage')

This will open the Messenger as if a new conversation was just created.

This function can also take an optional second parameter, used to pre-populate the message composer as shown in the code example below..

### Open For New Messages

```JavaScript
Intercom('showNewMessage');
```

```NPM
import { showNewMessage } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
showNewMessage();
```

### Pre-Populate Messages

Inbox Only
Pre-populating messages is only possible with our Inbox Essential & Pro product.

```JavaScript
Intercom('showNewMessage', 'pre-populated content');
```

```html
Send us
<a
  href="#"
  onclick="Intercom('showNewMessage', 'Feedback on the new reports feature:')"
  >your feedback on the reports feature</a
>
```

```npm
showNewMessage('pre-populated content');
```

## Intercom('onHide')

When we hide the messenger, you can hook into the event. This requires a function argument.

```JavaScript
Intercom('onHide', function() { /** Do stuff **/ });
```

```NPM
import { onHide } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
onHide();
```

## Intercom('onShow')

When we show the messenger, you can hook into the event. This requires a function argument.

```JavaScript
Intercom('onShow', function() { /** Do stuff **/ });
```

```NPM
import { onHide } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
onHide();
```

## Intercom('onUnreadCountChange')

This method allows you to register a function that will be called immediately when invoked, and again whenever the current number of unread messages changes.

```JavaScript
Intercom('onUnreadCountChange', function(unreadCount) {
  // Do stuff...
});
```

```NPM
import { onUnreadCountChange } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
onUnreadCountChange(function(unreadCount) {
  // Do stuff...
});
```

### Using with a Custom Launcher

If you use a custom launcher and also want to use the 'badge' delivery option, we recommend that you use the `onUnreadCountChange` method to show a badge on your custom launcher. If you use a custom launcher without a badge, you shouldn't use the badge delivery option.

## Intercom('trackEvent')

You can submit an event using the `trackEvent` method. This will associate the event with the currently logged in user and send it to Intercom. The final parameter is a map that can be used to send optional metadata about the event.

You can also add custom information to events in the form of event metadata, which can be included in event based messages to your customers.

```JavaScript
Intercom('trackEvent', 'invited-friend');
```

```JavaScript
var metadata = {
  invitee_email: 'pi@example.org',
  invite_code: 'ADDAFRIEND'
};

Intercom('trackEvent', 'invited-friend', metadata);
```

```NPM
import { trackEvent } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
trackEvent('invite-friend');
// or
trackEvent({ invite_code: 'ADDFRIEND' });
```

## Intercom('getVisitorId')

A visitor is someone who goes to your site but does not use the messenger. You can track these visitors via the visitor `user_id`. This `user_id` can be used to retrieve the visitor or lead through the REST API.

```JavaScript
Intercom('getVisitorId')
```

```NPM
import { getVisitorId } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
getVisitorId();
```

## Intercom('startTour', tourId)

If you would like to trigger a tour based on an action a user or visitor takes in your site or application, you can use this API method. You need to call this method with the id of the tour you wish to show. The id of the tour can be found in the â€œUse tour everywhereâ€ section of the tour editor.

Please note that tours shown via this API must be published and the â€œUse tour everywhereâ€ section must be turned on. If you're calling this API using an invalid tour id, nothing will happen. Nothing will happen if you call this API on mobile web as tours do not work on mobile.

```

```html
How about you
<a href="#" onclick="Intercom('startTour', 123)"

import { startTour } from "@intercom/messenger-js-sdk";
// ...
startTour(123);
```

## Intercom('showArticle', articleId)
